# Testimonials

If you would like to add a testimonial, go to [testimonials.json](https://github.com/iAldo801/ialdo801.github.io/blob/main/assets/misc/testimonials.json) and add your testimonial in the following format:

```json
{
  "name": "Your Name",
  "occupation": "Your Occupation",
  "social": "Any social media link you want to add (ONLY ONE)",
  "testimonial": "Your Testimonial"
}
```

Then, submit a pull request and I will review it and add it to the website.

# PD: You need to have worked with me to add a testimonial, or at minimum know me personally. I will not accept testimonials from people I have not worked with or do not know personally.
